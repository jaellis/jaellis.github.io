<title>A Good Dog by James A Ellis</title>
<div style="padding-left:150px;padding-bottom:50px; float:right;"><h1>A Good Dog</h1>
<h2 >J. Aaron Ellis</h2></div>
<body style="margin-left:120px;width:600px;">
	<span style="font-size:24px; margin-left:30px">He was a good dog.</span> <div align="justify" style="text-aling:justify; text-justify:inter-word; width:500px;">Aaron knew it at once.  Calm, level expression.  Muscles taut and aquiver under a tan coat.  That strong jaw. Aaron placed his hand on the kennel attendant’s shoulder, pointed at the pit-bull Shar-Pei mix, and shouted.  The attendant shouted back.  Around them a dozen desperate animals shouted through their cage bars.  On the adoption papers there was a line for Pet’s Name.  Aaron thought this odd and asked the attendant, a man with a shaggy brown mullet that made him a little too fitted for the job, if most adopters came with a name in mind.</div><br>
	<div align="left" style="float:left;width:300px;height:300px;font-size:22px;">“Don’t you think a name should <b>mean something?</b>” Aaron asked.<br><br><br>“It was my grandfather’s name.”</div><br>
	<div align="right" style="width:300px;height:300px;font-size:22px;float:right;"><br>“What’s your name mean?” the man asked through a Skoal-packed lip.
	<br><br><br>“Ya.  <span style="font-size:16px;"><b>And what’d his name mean?</b></span>”</div>
	<br><br>
	<div align="left" style="float:right;width:600px;padding-bottom:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron wrote <i>Parrot</i>, copying the name etched onto the dog’s cage, and spent the entire car ride home thinking glumly how much his new dog looked like a frog— <span style="clear:both; width:400px; float:left">some sort of African tree frog to be precise.  Flat-bottomed, almost bell-shaped face.  A white arrowhead on his otherwise brown chest.  </span></div><div align="right"><span style="clear:right;width:190px;margin-left:100px;float:left;font-size:22px;height:200;">Fat jowls, speckled paws, a smooth coat that shimmered aquatic in the failing summer light. </span></div><div id="rotateUP5" style="width:300px;float:right;justify-content:center;padding-bottom:20px;">But he had been taken by Parrot’s distinguishing feature and the dog’s muzzle,</div><div id="rotateDWN5" style="width:300px;float:right;justify-content:center;"> that hydraulic jaw of his, would bring Aaron to appreciate how perfect the name was.</div><br><br>
	<div style="width:600px; clear:both;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huiling, another tenant, remarked on the dog when Aaron walked him into the elevator. Parrot barely took notice of her.  He pawed at the carpeted floor once or twice, testing for give.<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“OH!  He’s boo-tiful!”<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stroked his coat and scratched him behind the ear.  Aaron reached down and slapped Parrot’s bulwark sides as an Admiral might the hull of a dry submarine.<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So strong!  So soft!” she told him.<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parrot blinked.  He lifted his head toward the two, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lingered &nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp;then looked back at the elevator doors.<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He’s a sturdy boy, you bet!” Aaron offered.<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept his excitement in check, though.  Even the fisherman who hits on his first cast knows it could be all day before another bite.  Let’s not have a relapse to the rent-a-dog days, he thought, remembering how he slobbered over the attention given his rented pup.  Only to stumble over simple questions like: how long have you had him?  Pound or breeder?  Questions that left him slack-jawed, sputtering about dog-sitting for a sick aunt, awkwardly turning the question around: do you have any pets?  No?  Oh, well—wanting to reach into his pocket and hand them the Rent-a-Pup card.<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huiling looks up while petting Parrot under the chin, and Aaron thinks that heaven must be a smorgasbord of women’s up-turned smiling faces.  Clouds made entirely of beautiful, female faces, paved with winking smiles and glossy eyes.</div><br>
	<div style="width:600px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up in his room he decided.  It was time for the dog park.  First day, or not, fate was on his side.  He yoked Parrot to the fresh harness and lead.  It reeked of a peculiar formaldehyde and vomit amalgam that marks all pet shop products.  They were halfway to the park when Aaron noticed the price tag was still poking through the lead and stumbled trying to tear it off.  Parrot surged forward relentlessly, steadily, chest high and ears perked.  They passed sidewalk cafes, window-walled liquor stores.  Grocers dug into city blocks like misaligned wisdom teeth.  Aaron found himself emulating Parrot.  He straightened his back and squeezed a distinctly masculine pleasure out of the ripple and jounce every step jarred from his flaccid stomach.  He’d lose that.  Just another benefit of dog-walking.  He had a list on his desk: <div id="rotateUP5" style="font-family:'Pacifico';padding-left:20px; padding-top:20px; width:250px; height:250px; background-color:#FFFFCC;"><ul><li>better posture</li><li>arm strength</li><li>balance</li><li>girls’ numbers</li><li>book clubs<x style="font-size:16px; background-color:#FFFFCC;"> (?)</x></li><li>dog-dates</li><li>fresh air <x style="font-size:16px; background-color:#FFFFCC;">(!)</x></li></ul></div></div>
	<div style="height:120px; width:100%;"></div>
	<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog park occupied the superfluous triangle of land left by </div><div id ="triangle" style=""><div id="stretch1" style="position:absolute; margin-left:100px; width:200px;">East-West <b>S</b> street,</div><div id="rotateDWN90" style="font-size:22; margin-left:210px; margin-top:90px; width:200px; position:absolute; padding-top:100px;">North-running <b>17th</b></div><div id="rotateDWN40" style="float:left; width:300px; margin-bottom:100px; margin-top:170px;">and obnoxiously diagonal <b>Rhode Island</b>.</div></div><div>A couple hundred square feet.  Recently fenced and covered in banked Astroturf.  Benches sitting on gravel under a neat row of acacia trees.  It was the picture of simple, elegant and ergonomic, quasi-Socialist common space that imprinted the entire neighborhood like watermarked stationary.  Half a block away, Aaron—caught up in a Jack London reverie about man and dog—realized he hadn’t shaved in four days and nearly turned back.  Parrot would have nothing of it.  He pulled Aaron along, legs pumping and head rock-steady.</div><br>
	<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They passed a ragged man sitting in the gutter, head bent over a chewed Styrofoam cup, repeating a blessing to everyone who passed. </div><div align="justify" style="float:left; width:100px;padding-right:50px;padding-bottom:20px;padding-top:20px;">Aaron positioned himself behind another pedestrian.</div><br><div style="margin-left:100px;padding-top:70px;">  Parrot walked over and stuck his nose directly in the cup as the man dropped into silence, breathing shallow and letting the dog violate his cup.<br><br>
	“Sorry,” Aaron said, tugging vainly, face growing hot.</div><br>
	<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man asked him to buy a new cup, a replace-me.  Aaron muttered a senseless string of apologies, bending against Parrot’s cup fetish, sweating, pulling, and slowly plodding off.</div><br>
	<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11px;">She was there.</span>  Of course she was, and he hadn’t shaved.  His dreams of White Fang disintegrated.  The chest out, shoulders back stance made his cheeks flush.  And against red Irish stubble!  Miranda spotted him and waved.  Aaron nodded, touched the brim of a hat he wasn’t wearing in a John Wayne manner.  <span style="font-size:11px;">Stupid</span>.  He kept his head down and made a show of fumbling with Parrot’s harness.  Parrot obliged when needed, lifting a leg here, letting his head be </div><div id="skew1" style="position:absolute;">turned,</div><div id ="rotateUP5" style="width:50px; float:left; padding-left:10px;">raised</div><div id="rotateDWN5" style="float:left; padding-left:10px; width:100px;">and lowered.</div><div>  He never once looked at Aaron.  His deep, brown eyes seemed to let the scene, the scrum of dogs bouncing back and forth, wash over and soak in.  Water down a drain, swirling, vanishing.</div><br>
	<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron closed the first gate and opened the second, expecting Parrot to dash off.  He dusted his hands off, practiced lines of conversation in his head, laughed at possible jokes and judged the laughter for sincerity.  He took a step forward and kicked Parrot in the rear.  Parrot hadn’t moved more than a few steps.  With a puzzled Aaron watching, Parrot advanced a few more, raised and lowered his tail, then sat.</div>
	<div><br>
	“Come on, boy!”<br><br>
	Aaron squatted down next to him.<br><br>
	“Aww,” came Miranda’s cheerful voice over the bass growl of the dog pack, “Somebody’s a little shy!”<br><br>
	<span style="font-size:11px;">Why did she have to put it like that?</span><br><br>
	“Just first day jitters!” said Aaron.  He forced a laugh.  Loudly.<br><br>  Parrot looked at him.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their eyes met for the first time since the kennel, and for the first time at such proximity.  Aaron—no other way to put it—was terrified.  And terrified in the manner of a lone, night-blind hiker that trips and finds himself before a glittering, inky set of bears’ eyes.  Filled with a terror that names constellations.  Terror that lives on in the kernelled heart of a thousand fraternal horror stories.  Aaron tipped over backwards, more like scrambled.  Parrot regarded him a moment longer then returned to his silent vigil.  Eventually he lay down, extending one paw, one leg at a time, in a controlled descent until his assumed the sphinx position.<br>
	Miranda walked over.<br>
	“He’s got quite a bearing about him, huh?  Where did you get him?  He reminds me of my Uncle Jed’s dogs.  A couple of them he got from buddies who did the Iditarod.  Great dogs.  Noble as hell.  They just make you think of kings and castles.  I could see that one flushing out some foxes,” she said, indicating Parrot.<br>
	Aaron looked up at the underside of Miranda’s chin and watched her throat bob slightly as she swallowed.  Her eyes went down to Aaron and she winked.<br>
	“You should get a horse next,” she said.  “Then you just need squires.”</div><br>
	<div>He struggled to his feet, not un-awkwardly, saying, “Maybe I’ll just rent one from the Capitol Police.”<br>
	“You know, they should start carrying bugles.  Like sirens for horseback cops,” she dreamt.<br>
	“Just imagine,” he said, “A hunting party of husky, uniformed men on horseback, chasing down a pickpocket.  Bugles flaring.”<br>
	“Beagles barking.”<br>
	They laughed for some time, heartily and without reservations.  Parrot watched them.  Then he stood, walked to the manicured line of benches, and lifted his right leg over a leash that was laying on the ground.
	Aaron, catching his breath, asked about Miranda’s dog.  She asked about his job.  They spent a few minutes trading trivial comments on the mayoral race, road construction, and the sad state of fresh produce in the city.  A transcript would have read like the kvetching of two elder Jewish matrons.  But they were young and when they sighed in tandem it was full of anxious energy.
	“Well,” Miranda said and shrugged, “I’ll bring the post-hunt cakes?”
	Aaron laughed.  The moment had passed and he couldn’t think of much to resurrect it.  He assured her he would come hungry, and that the fox would be released humanely, and thumbed his pockets.</div>
	<div>“Hey,” he said as she turned after saying goodbye.  She tucked a bouncy cord of hair behind her ear and gave Aaron her number when he asked.  With that, she leashed her Labrador, a chestnut-colored mix, eased her way out the double iron gates and jogged the half block to the corner before disappearing.  Aaron turned reluctantly, eyes leading his head like antennae, to find Parrot.
	The dog was sitting on the crest of the small ridge that divided the park.  Surveying.  Aaron approached with the harness outstretched.  With all the haste and care of one handling explosives, he slipped the harness over Parrot’s head and feed through his legs.  Finished, he put his face to the dog’s, slowly, timorously at first, but eventually to where he felt the soft breath on his cheeks.  He wanted to say something that would assert ownership.  If only to edify himself, to rest his own fears.  But they sat there with eyes locked.  And Aaron felt no urge to talk, but neither did he feel the same cold wash of fear down the back of his neck.  He sat, and Parrot sat, both on all fours.  He sniffed, Parrot licked his whiskered lip, and they peered at the other until the ruck of dogs came crashing through, snapping and yelping juvenilely.</div>

	<div>At first, he only took Parrot to sanctioned premises.  To dog parks, to the Mall.  People were attracted to his stoic character.  His dismissive nature was magnetic.  Parrot felt many hands those first few months, sat through countless throw-away conversations between Aaron and animal-loving strangers.  Men and women, Aaron wasn’t picky when it came to small talk.  To the women, he would inquire about pets, hobbies, residence, workplace.  Anything that might converge their respective realms of influence.  One night, under lamplight, Aaron made an entry in his journal—one he had kept since the days of renting dogs and socializing through his temp pets began.  He wrote it while laying on the floor of his room, rubbing his bare foot on Parrot’s back.  It was entitled “Parrot as the Balkans” and stretched eight pages in fine script.  Aaron mused how he, the United States, was in a social arms race with any given stranger, the Soviet Union, which had built up an arbitrary and useless arsenal of gadgets to socialize.  Similar to the Cold War, the only tangible weapons were allies, and therefore deterrence—in this case from depression and loneliness.  Parrot, dog and social kludge—something ancient and rediscovered—was the Balkans: the economically backwards, intellectually stunted, passive and unsupposing battleground.  He’d win the war by going back to basics.  Parrot was to him what the all-American kitchen display in Moscow was to Nixon, what Waterloo was to the Duke of Wellington.  He kneaded his toes into Parrot’s muscle-laden side and assumed a Russian accent, saying, “You are good dog, da?  Parrot: dis is good, stronk dog name, no?”</div>
	<div>He explained the journal entry to Miranda over brunch.  The waiter had just come by to patiently explain, again, that no dogs were allowed inside the patio fence.  Aaron told him that this was a service dog, his hearing-ear dog.  The waiter, puzzled, retreated to the kitchen shaking his head.
	“Getting really attached to Slovenia, I see,” said Miranda.
	Aaron stretched his arms overhead, feeling the soreness from days and weeks of being jerked around by Parrot.  The added weight.  The extra pull between his shoulder blades.
	“Economic ties.  Our relationship is mutually beneficial, comrade.”
	“Quit it,” Miranda flicked Aaron with some Bloody Mary off her celery stick.  
	“Ah, red.  A good, stronk color,” Aaron chuckled.  She hadn’t spent the night, but they were sharing a hangover from the same party—it was a step. </div> 
	<div>“Where’s Henry?” he asked.
	“At home, can’t bring him out here.  I’m not hearing impaired.” Miranda bit crisply into the celery and chewed, “Plus, Parrot’s no good with other dogs.”
	“He’s just a loner that’s all.”
	“Nope,” she replied, “No, I don’t think he likes other dogs one bit.  I’d be careful.”
	“You’re just a worrywart.  And what if he doesn’t?  You’d need a pack of wolves to take him down,” Aaron thumped Parrot on the ribs.  Miranda sipped her drink and they sat enjoying the cool breeze and murmur of conversation around them.  Silence well sat; but Aaron, chewing ice, still felt the nervous urge to speak and fill it.</div>
	<div>A police officer in blues walked up to his cruiser and set down a coffee on the roof before kneeling to tie his boots.  Aaron, already facing his direction, watched blithely.  Parrot made a rumbling sound deep in his chest.  His ears folded back then twitched forward, like the flex of insipid wings.  Out of the corner of his eye, Aaron caught Miranda as she glanced between the dog and the cop.  For some reason, Aaron let it happen.  He didn’t try to calm Parrot, he didn’t give Miranda an assuring look.  He didn’t make more of an apology than shrugging to the officer when Parrot let out a sharp crack of a bark that brought several Oh!’s, a clatter of silverware, and then complete silence to the patio.  The waiter dashed over and informed the sir that he had to take his dog elsewhere, at once.  Aaron seemed not to hear, and the waiter—momentary center of attention—bashfully marked it up to the hearing impairment, scampering off again and leaving Aaron, chest out and back straight, looking level eyed at the officer who had bumped backwards into his car and now stood in a pool of street-dashed coffee.  Why he hadn’t stopped Parrot, he didn’t know.  But Miranda was wide-eyed and a flush started to bridge her nose.</div>
	<div>“Sorry ‘bout that, officer,” said Aaron, never breaking his gaze, but heart racing, “He didn’t mean anything by it.”
	The officer, a brawny man whose forearms squeezed out of his constricting, rolled-up sleeves like tree trunks, said nothing.  From under the dark eave of his forehead his eyes smoldered.  He wiped droplets of coffee off his black boots, stooped to pick up the cup, and crushed it in his fist.  His knuckles bulged white and calcified, and were furrowed down the middle like molars.
	“Well,” was all Miranda said after the policeman drove off.
	Aaron turned his head.  “I didn’t see a pack of wolves,” he said.  “Just one pig.”
	Miranda shook her head, giggling.  A fresh dash of tomato juice and vodka hit Aaron’s cheek.  He finally let out his breath.</div>
	<div>“Sir.”  A pause.  The library attendant shuffled.  He tapped Aaron on the shoulder, “Sir?”
	Parrot lay across the aisle between two rows of low-slung desks, the soft light of the Graduate library giving the students hunched over paper drifts all perfect complexions.  Except the pimpled attendant.  Aaron took a card from his wallet, handed it to the lonely scrub-haired kid.  He squinted to read it in the stacks’ perpetual twilight but couldn’t.  He leaned in under Aaron’s desk lamp, giving him a defenseless and uncomfortable grin.  Aaron tapped his fingers on the desk, clicked his pen, and stared at the side of the attendant’s face—not six inches from his own.</div>
	<div>“Oh,” the attendant sighed.   He leaned back, ran a hand through his shaggy scalp, “I’m sorry, sir.  I didn’t realize.”
	Parrot squirmed under the service-issue harness that rose like a sail off his back.  Aaron presented this evidence to the attendant with an flat hand.  The attendant scratched the side of his face.
	"Well, you see.  I hate to do it, sir.  But, library policy, you know?  Only seeing-eye dogs allowed.”
	“Into a library!” Aaron blurted out.  The attendant staggered back, panicked.  “How the hell—what!—why would a blind person come here!”
	“For the Braille section, sir!  They read Braille!  Now you have to leave, I’m sorry!”  He stuck Aaron’s note out and constricted the little curls of skin under his eyes.</div>
	<div>Once outside, Aaron swapped the handicap harness for Parrot’s regular collar.  They started walking, crunching beige gravel underfoot.  He called Leonard, a guy from the dog park, and reached an answering machine.  Then he tried Deborah, the waitress who gave him that last beer gratis after swooning over Parrot for the first three, glancing up all the while, beaming.  Heavenly.  But no response.  Aaron muttered under his breath.  The sunlight was dwindling, a glow suffused the horizon and spread an orange lichen over the townhouse roofs of Dupont.  Aaron and Parrot followed the trickle of pedestrians toward the subway entrance.  The trees around the hospital were sequestered in low-fenced plots of dirt and over one of these was stretched the homeless man.  Arched backward.  Impossible he’s alive, the way his back was bent.  Impaled.  But more impossible—Aaron noticed a gaggle of police officers chatting over their dusk coffee—impossible would be a dead man, lying on the steps of a hospital, in the Nation’s capital, as mothers and daughters pass by on their way back from the Smithsonian.  Aaron stood over the man for a second, not sure if the man’s torn jacket was rising and falling or if it was the breeze.  His phone buzzed.  Parrot sniffed the man’s crotch as Aaron opened his phone.  A text message from Leonard.  And a moment later, one from the waitress.  They both wanted to know what’s up?  Aaron flipped a quarter onto the man’s chest and he stirred.  His fingers, sticking through the torn ends of filthy gloves, groped blindly for the coin.  Found, the man mumbled a blessing to Aaron and went limp again.</div>
	<div>Aaron stuck his hands into his pants pockets, Parrot continued his inspection of the man’s muddy Nikes.
	“You need something to eat, boss?”
	It took some time for Aaron to help the man up.  He quickly regretted the decision, and offered to bring something back but they both know he wouldn’t.  One of the officers watched as they walked past.  They found a booth in McDonald’s, Aaron ordered two Big Mac’s and an ice cream sundae that sublimated instantly on his tongue.
	“How long you been on the streets?”
	Mel, his name was Mel, had a runny nose that coated his upper lip with a mixture of snot and Special Sauce.  He only closed his mouth to swallow.  Aaron knew the disgust is clear as crystal on his face but Mel didn’t do him the courtesy of meeting his eyes.  The air around them shared the same benign animosity of traffic court or a holding cell.
	Mel said, two years, no, four.  His old lady took all the money in the divorce, he had drug problems his family just wouldn’t put up with anymore.  He used to stay at the Mission but he got kicked out for fighting, some guy kept stealing his pillow, another his candy.  He was onto Big Mac number two after a half-dozen bites.
	Mel nodded to Parrot, said that he was a prison dog.</div>
	<div>“What’s that mean?”
	Mel said, there was two types of dogs.  Prison dogs.  And Princess dogs.  That was prison dog if he’d ever seen one.
	“Nah, he’s a sweetheart.  Just got a tough skin.”
	Mel reached down and gave Parrot the last of his Big Mac.  He looked Aaron over.  He asked him, why he get him a prison dog if he wanted a princess dog?
	“I didn’t want a princess.  I wanted a pit-bull.  I got exactly the dog I wanted,” said Aaron out of the corner of his mouth.
	Mel sucked a sesame seed from between his teeth.  He said Aaron was all right.  He told him, sometimes you go to prison and sometimes the prison come to you.  He said, sometimes you think you living in a castle, a pretty one, with pretty princesses and princess dogs and you really just in prison; walls is still stone, windows still got bars in ‘em.  He stood up, leaving without shaking Aaron’s hand again, and shrugged, ‘cause who know: maybe castles is prisons or they ain’t, and all dogs is just dogs.  God bless.</div>
	<div>The sun was bright on Adams Morgan Day.  Aaron squinted through the crowd and in between the white caravan tents, over display racks of Bangladeshi skirts, looking for Miranda.  Parrot was in a frenzy, well, a relative frenzy.  He jerked his head this way and that.  Dogs of all make and mold filled the street as it made an uphill curve towards the bridge.  Hands passed over his head and vanished into the crowd, disembodied and brusque.  Aaron called Miranda.  He tried to give her his location, then said, screw it, just call me whenever you get this.  He spotted a cute redhead walking a Bernese puppy and made a bee-line.  If Miranda wasn’t going to show up he would have a good time with someone else.</div>
	<div>The girl had a delicate nose and sharp cheek bones and was struggling to keep the mountain dog, still just a puppy, heeled.  Aaron showed her how to loop the end of the leash over her thumb and run the lead through her fist in a sort of dog-walker’s Chinese finger trap.  She blushed the entire time, furiously.  Aaron watched her moist lips as she told him how she had always wanted a Bernese but that they had always seemed so much calmer.  She pointed to Parrot and asked him what the secret was.  Parrot had tired of the Bernese, allowing the puppy to frolic around his rear-end while he scanned the crowd.
	A woman around fifty came towards them, wearing a white doily skirt and a tangerine blouse.  Her poodle, a conglomeration of puffy clouds attached to a red leash, promenaded in front of her.  They came up to Aaron, the girl and their two dogs, now becoming a cluster of nervous sniffing and circling.  The Bernese puppy was apoplectic, rolling, somersaulting, cowering.  The poodle stood aloof.  Parrot gave it a brief once-over.“Darling, that puppy is a-DOOR-able,” said the woman.  She had a brittle and manicured look that Aaron associated with an inheritance run dry.  The girl thanked her, and tugged at the puppy vainly.
	“Here,” Aaron offered to take her leash.  The poodle snapped and Parrot split the warm air with a yelp.</div>
	<div>Trying to make sense of a dog fight is like trying to pick out a sock while the dryer is going full tumble.  Aaron saw a speckle of red on Parrot’s snout one instant, then flashes of canine teeth, another spot of red appearing on the poodle’s paw, and finally Parrot clamping down on the other dog’s leg.  The poodle thrashed madly.  Aaron moved forward instinctively but fell under the same shock trance as every other spectator.  It was just so vicious, so primal.</div>
	 <div>The woman yelled for help.  She yelled at her dog, Sushi!  Help!  Someone!
	Aaron dove on top of Parrot and pulled at his jaw with both hands.  It wouldn’t budge.  Parrot swung his entire body left and then right, and Aaron heard the sickly crunch of bone breaking.  The poodle howled.  A chorus of dogs around them joined in.  People yelled for help.  Several police officers started to make their way through the crowd, dark blue fins cutting through a pastel sea.
	Desperate, Aaron shoved his hand into Parrots mouth, right at the hinge of his jaw.  He knew he was being bitten, he could feel it in some far off place, but all he saw were horrified faces.  All he thought was, this isn’t him.  He doesn’t mean it.  He’s not a bad dog.  He wedged his hand further into Parrot’s throat until his index and middle finger were rubbing something ribbed and cartilaginous.  Parrot choked and let go of the poodle.</div>
	<div>As Aaron removed his hand, he felt another, a pair of much larger hands, on his back.  He was lifted off Parrot, rolled onto his side, and he saw the officer wedge and knee into the back of Parrot’s neck.  He shouted that everything was OK!  The officer saw his hand, blood running around Aaron’s thumb.  The officer looked at the poodle as Parrot struggled beneath him.  The blood on the white poodle was stark and frightening.  Parrot yelped, tried to roll over.
	He started to slip free.  The officer, giving a grunt, grabbed a hold of the collar, snatched a handful of loose neck skin with his other hand and threw Parrot down a short flight of steps.  Aaron scrambled to his feet as Parrot disappeared into the stairwell and the officer drew his service weapon.  A gun.  The officer wielded it so effortlessly, leveled it down the stairwell as if it carried no weight of its own and were merely an extension of his arm.  Aaron expected the man’s arm to fly backward when the single report ruptured through the air.  But there was no movement, only the cavernous echo of the bullet and the vacuum it left behind like the violent hush of a forest fire.</div>
	<div>Aaron cowered on the ground.  Everyone was cowering on the ground.  The only men on their feet wore navy blue uniforms and unforgiving expressions.  They quickly ushered the crowd away from the scene.  Aaron staggered forward on his hands and knees, rising before falling back down to one knee when he saw the thick lather of blood on the top step.  The officer was looking at him, holstering his weapon, when Aaron slowly let his gaze rise.  It was the officer from the café.  From the brunch with Miranda.  From the coffee, and the bark, and the first night Parrot slept at the foot of his bed.  But the man’s eyes weren’t flinty.  He glanced down the stairwell and seemed to go blank for a long moment.  Another officer helped Aaron to his feet.  Aaron lashed out at the man, called him a bastard, accused him of premeditated murder.  Murderer!  He found himself pushed backward against the side of a delivery van, being told to just calm down now, we’ll sort this out.</div>
	<div>They were.  Things.  They were sorted out.  They were very straight forward in the end.  Sushi the poodle had received numerous lacerations and two broken bones from Parrot the pit bull.  The dog had been unsuccessfully subdued by his owner and a DCPD officer—trained animal handler and certified K-9 operator—was forced to intervene.  The pit bull had a bloody nose and appeared to be out of control.  The officer, receiving a bite to the hand and wrist, picked up the pit bull and threw it down a stairway.  The dog fell to the ground, got up and charged up the stairs.  The officer, fearing for his safety and the safety of the large crowd gathered, discharged one round from his departmental issued 9MM Glock, striking the pit bull, causing it to fall.  The pit bull later expired.  Animal control was notified and responded to the scene to remove the pit bull.  Cruiser 300, Lt. Carroll, Adams Morgan 1, and Lt. Jova, Crime Scene Search responded to the scene.</div>
	<div>Aaron didn’t organize the vigil, but wasn’t surprised that it was put together, by someone.  This was a city of principles, after all.  And dog-murdering is unprincipled.  What surprised him were the hundred people who showed up in the slogging rain, holding candles under tarpaulins and umbrellas, and breaking into spontaneous verse:<div>

	<div>My Dog was an Awesome Dog/
	He Reined from Heaven Above/
	With Wisdom, Power and Love/
	My Dog was an Awesome Dog.</div>
		
	<div>It was touching, sure.  The local news came with a van but they only sent the cameraman out into the rain.  From under the visor of his hood, Aaron could make out the anchorwoman and a sound tech in the front, sipping from hot Styrofoam cups.  Miranda held his hand as he thanked everyone for coming.  Then she had to go home, she just felt like she had to hold Henry for a while.  But she wanted to make sure Aaron was all right first.  He said he was.  He stood and watched the mourners—if felt wrong to call them that—he watched the last few huddled together like orphaned children at a parent’s grave and felt an angry bile rise in his throat.  He pushed through them and took Parrot’s collar from the make-shift altar.
	Mel wasn’t by the hospital.  Aaron chided himself for thinking the man would be out in the rain, lying over his rail.  But he left the collar all the same.  He would tell Mel he was right when he saw him again.  Or maybe he wouldn’t have to.  Maybe Mel knew all along, and dogs were just dogs.  He was a good dog, though, even if he were a prison dog.  Maybe being a prison dog is like being short, or pigeon-toed and hard of hearing, and it doesn’t really have much of anything to do with anything when you get down to it.  If what they say is true—and it is—it’s all smiles for the dogs in the end.</div>
